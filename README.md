# Master-Thesis-late-2022
This is my master's thesis, which is an extension of a project paper whose files are in a different repository. 

During the creation of the master's work were also used programming languages C / C + + to obtain data from the Siemens controller. As well as Python to create the interface and interaction with the data (their receipt and sending). 

The whole project consists of Python, but when creating the language was used C, which was then converted to Python for simplicity and for the presence of a single program.

To start the program you need to run gui.py file. 
But first you need to choose the algorithm you want to run. 

For example, if you want to test neural networks, then run a file called "gui_Keras_KNN.py" or "gui_Keras_KNN_with ready Model.py".
If you want to test SVM Algorithm, them run a file with a name "gui_SVM-Algorithm.py".
And so on...

And also don't forget to download and install these important libraries: sklearn, pandas and dearpygui

To install a new framework just write that in console "pip install [Name of library]". 

For example: "pip install sklearn"

You can also read the very detailed information and description of the scheme of work, which is in the file of my work "Masterarbeit Skorobogatov Maksim PDF format"

If there are any problems or bugs, please contact me. My name is Skorobogatov Maksim (email adress: makskorobogat@gmail.com)

Have fun!
